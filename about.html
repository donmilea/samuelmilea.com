  <title>Samuel Milea // Composer</title>

</head>


<p class="">I'm a composer and musician based in Wiltshire, England.<br><br>

  The music that I write encompasses many styles and influences, and involves a variety of instruments. Recently, I've been composing a piece for the bass viol, intended as a 2nd movement to my piece from 2019, entitled <em>Unvoiced</em>.
  As well
  as this, I've been compiling a book of Tudor-inspired compositions for beginner and intermediate guitarists.<br><br>

  In 2019, I graduated with an MA in Composition from the Royal Academy of Music. Whilst there, I studied with David Sawer and Morgan Hayes. Prior to this, I studied for a BMus in Composition with Param Vir at the University of West
  London.<br><br>

  Over recent years, I've had the pleasure to compose for a variety of fantastic ensembles and soloists. These include the Hermes Experiment; the Ligeti Quartet; bass violist Liam Byrne; the London Metropolitan Brass; the Royal Academy of
  Music Orchestra; and soprano Pia Davila. Alongside this, I've worked on collaborative film projects with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, as well as acted as Producer for singer-songwriters.
  <br><br>

  My music has been performed in venues in the UK and internationally, such as LSO St Luke's, London; the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, London; The Vaults, London; Chapel Arts, Cheltenham; Kunst-Universität, Graz; Heidelberger Frühling,
  Germany; and the Royal Academy of Music, London. As a Producer, I've enjoyed radio play on BBC Radio Wiltshire and BBC Introducing.<br><br>

  In the past, I've received generous support from the RVW Trust, the Countess of Munster Musical Trust and the Leathersellers’ Company Charitable Trust.
